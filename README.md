# Feature Visualization of Morphed Faces

The characteristic of the activation maps is observed by extracting the features of the morphed faces by using pre-trained [VGG-Face Descriptor](https://github.com/rcmalli/keras-vggface). These extracted features are plotted using t-SNE.
[t-SNE](http://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) is one of the non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques which is particularly used for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets.
## Literature Survey

[Feature Visualization of Morphed Faces Literature Survey](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uU9kPHTaS0MxCuurGiXUTWZ7KZEFM9jF/view?usp=sharing)
## Libraries
List of libraries need to be installed to execute the code:
* python - 3.6
* keras-1.2.1
* Tensorflow 
* Numpy
* Spacy
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV
* Jupyter
* Scikit-Learn

## Notes
* Dataset contains only 1 image pair. Images can't be shared due to confidentiality.
* The results can be view in the literature survey.
* Custom dataset can be tested by running the jupyter-notebook and setting the image path.
